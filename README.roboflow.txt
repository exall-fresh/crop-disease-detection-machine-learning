The dataset includes 2308 images.
Disease-in-plants are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -22 and +22 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.75 pixels
